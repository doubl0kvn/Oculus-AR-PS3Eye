# Oculus-AR-PS3Eye
Augmented Reality application source code using OpenFrameworks.  
This code is specifically designed for the Oculus Rift and the PS3Eye

Built off of terrybroad's Mediated-Perceptions Oculus Rift Project: https://github.com/terrybroad/Mediated-Perceptions

Notes:
1. Make sure to ensure that the /bin/data directory contains the shaders folder
2. Both cameras have been hardcoded as camera 1 and 2.  (Assumes that the computer running the program has only 1 existing program (other than the stereo cameras)
3. Theoretically this program should be able to adapt to any stereoscopic camera setup, as long as the input resoultions are modified (Ex: PS3Eye uses 640 x 800, so that is currently hardcoded)
